            HOW TO WRITE A SCHOOL NEWS ARTICLE
          </h3>
          <p>
            News articles are designed to relate the news. The article is written to inform readers. It is factual, meant to present information in a quick, digestible form. The following elements of writing a newspaper article are important, so heed them well.
          </p>
          <h4>
            RESEARCH AND FACT GATHERING
          </h4>
          <p>
            Perhaps the #1 rule of writing a newspaper article is that you are factual. You do not want to make assumptions or fabricate information. Before you can write your article, you must have as many of the facts as you can gather. Here are some facts that you will need to find out:
          </p>
          <ul>
	<li><b>What?</b> The specific event that took place.</li>
	<li><b>Who?</b> The people involved.</li>
	<li><b>Where?</b> Places.</li>
	<li><b>When?</b> Date and time.</li>
	<li><b>Why?</b> Reasons for the event taking place.</li>
	<li><b>How?</b> Connecting the facts.</li>
</ul>
